<p>This is precisely the extension I've been looking for. I would like
more options, though. I really have no need of the google bar at the
top, and I'd like to be able to set it to use only a certain folder in
my bookmarks folder. Sage requires you to keep a folder of RSS feeds in
your bookmarks and I'd rather not have them on my home page.</p>

<p>If you do step 4 ([..]overlayinfo folder) of the uninstallation, the
button will be removed. I'll think of something better for the next
version.</p>

<p>I think most people won't use the exclude option, and if they do, it
will only be occasionally. So trying to reduce the number of clicks
doesn't seem worthwhile. Also, making the interface more complex, will
make understanding it harder. And I've tried to keep the options window
as small as possible, so that changes can also be seen without changing
focus to the BMHome window. I assume that people will change the colors
more often than their excluded folders and then it is convenient to
have a small options window (which btw reminds me that I'd like to
receive some more stylesheets!). However, if you disagree with me, I'd
like to hear it.</p>

<p>Uh...nevermind? Turns out the options via Extension dropdown isn't
where you find options...they're at the bottom of the page. I have a
full personal toolbar, so the BM Home button was off the screen to the
right...never saw it until I cleaned out some of the stuff showing on
the toolbar.</p>

<p>Hi Joeren</p>
<p>&gt; won't use the exclude option, and if they do, it will only be occasionally</p>
<p>yes, same for the include option - in most cases it will be a one time
<br>configuration ...
<br>&gt; So trying to reduce the number of clicks doesn't seem worthwhile</p>
<p>now, I'm using _large_ bookmarkfiles, collected over the years. It would be
<br>nice to have some parts of it as a homepage, but not all the bookmarks (probably
<br>it would crash the browser ;) and it wouldn't be very concise). So for me that
<br>means to exclude several dozen of entries, while only a few folders were included
<br>(and that is a pain with the small box;) )</p>

<p>&gt; Also, making the interface more complex, will make understanding it harder</p>
<p>now, a single additional button wouldn't clutter the interface, or?</p>
<p>
<br>&gt; I assume that people will change the colors more often than their excluded folders
<br>&gt; and then it is convenient to have a small options window</p>
<p>really? I don't think so. In most cases this too will be a one time configuration</p>

<p>Yes, I have a lot of extensions, but currently am not able to
reproduce the problem with the "bookmarks page not opening" anymore -
it works now.
<br>For the Open in tabs: the headings in the bookmark page (which are
in fact bookmark folders) are currently not clickable - and if they
were, they should do something fancy. I am not sure how Linky could fit
in this picture?</p>

<p>Sander,
<br>I've seen the same problem with some of my early experiments, but
only on windows, not on linux. Anyhow, finding the cause will probably
be virtually impossible for me. However, I'll recreate the problem I
had on windows and try to find a way around it.Progress will be
announced on the todo page (or you can subscribe to the mailing list).
One more thing: when this happens, can you check the
Tools-&gt;Javascript Console for error messages?</p>
<p>I think your idea to make links of the headings that open the
folder's bookmarks in new tabs (or windows, I'll probably add that as
an option) is great!!
<br>It will be implemented in the next version.</p>
<p>For the sake of completeness: Linky allows you to select links like
you select text and let them be opened in new tabs. This way you can
open all links in a folder.</p>

<p>I really loved this extension but it doesn't work anymore... I had
to create a new profile because of some troubles with another extension
(sessionsaver) and now, when I click on options at the bottom of the
page created by bookmarksHome, Firefox crashes. Then I created a new
profile again, with only bookmarkshome installed, so no other
extensions, and I had the same problem so I don't think it's a matter
of conflicting extensions.</p>
<p>Then I got an idea and I opened my old Firefox (0.9.3) (the very
first time I installed BMHome was also in this version) and installed
the extension again from there, and there it worked! So hoped it would
work again as well in Firefox PR 1.0 but there it still crashes...</p>

<p>Sander,
<br>I'll work on the livemarks.
<br>Heidi,
<br>I'm sorry for all the problems you have with bmh. bmh seems to work
fine in ff 1.0 on windows and linux (at least the options window).
Unfortunately I don't have a mac, so there's not much I can do.
However, later this week, a new version of bmh will be available with a
completely rewritten options window. So, hopefully the new version will
work. I'd like to hear about it.

<p>Jem,
<br>I removed the BMHome button, because personal toolbar buttons are
more flexible and, in mozilla, if you set bmh as your homepage, you'll
have 2 buttons (Home and BMHome) referring to the same page. I'm
working on the livemarks. I thought the best way to handle them, was
just to display them as a folder (like in the bmmanager).</p>

<p>I like the extension, but am going back to v1.1.1. It seems without
the BMHome button the only way to use this new extension is to make it
the start page, which I don't want to do. I preferred using my existing
portal, and having the button option to switch to your creation.</p>

<p>Stacman,
<br>I wrote Personal Toolbar buttons in my response to Jem, but what I
meant was Personal Toolbar FOLDER buttons, or, in ff, the Bookmarks
Toolbar Folder. That is, you should just bookmark bmh into this folder
and a button will appear on your personal toolbar.</p>
<p>Ironically however, mozilla/ff does not bookmark the right url, but something like</p>
<p>wyciwyg://0/chrome://bookmarkshome/content/bookmarksHome.html</p>
<p>You have to remove the wyciwyg://0/ part (in the bookmark's
properties) to make the bookmark (button) work. If I had known this in
time, I wouldn't have removed the BMHome button of course...</p>

be more convenient as part of the toolbar and on the left side.</p>

<p>What I would like to see in next version is a posibility to upload
the generated page to some remote FTP/SFTP location. The ftp url should
be configured in the options dialog with possibility to specify user,
pass or both. </p>
<p>If the FTP location is present in the options, the local page should
contain one more link, next to options, which says "update remote". The
page placed at the remote location should not contain this link.</p>
<p>If user name or pass is not specified, the plugin should pop a modal
dialog prompting the user to enter them. If only one is specified, it
should be prefilled.</p>
<p>I'm pondering the option to implement it myself, but so far I don't
have any experience with moz plugins and ya know.. I'm lazy :-)</p>

<p>Dimiter (sorry for previously misspelling your name),
<br>I think both stylesheets have their merits. In your last stylesheet
however, the options link has moved to the top right of the page and is
hardly visible because of the background color. Probably you want to
change that. Also, you can simply hide the searchform by selecting
'None' as your default engine.</p>

<p>Jeroen,</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip about the search box.</p>
<p>The options link is meant to be in the top-right corner of the
bookmarks table, thus the background should be white. I put it there
because I thought it's a non-intrusive, still easy to spot place (upper
right corner.) I have to think about some other solution.</p>
<p>Another issue is that I want to make the folder titles to take less
space. My current folder structure is up to 4 levels deep and the
headers get largish. I tried to specify that the BR elements should
display inline, and to add '/' as generated content before each BR but
so far, can't make it work.</p>

<p>Dimiter,
<br>I think it's a good idea to have some sort of ftp functionality.
There are a number of projects that allow you to transfer your
bookmarks (which I think is a better idea than transferring the page,
since you could also use the options window then). I'll try to find out
more and will also think about the best way to integrate this
functionality with bmh. I´d be happy to tell you all about mozilla
extensions (well..at least about this one) and work together with you,
so if you think you can get over your lazyness, just send me an email.</p>

<p>Heidi,
<br>The wyciwyg bug (see todo) was caused by my fix of the
bmh-not-always-loading-properly-on-windows bug. The back-button bug and
the duplicate-bmh-tab bug are caused by my fix of the wyciwyg bug
(sigh...). I could not reproduce the command(ctrl?)-T bug. The
bmh-not-always-loading-properly-on-windows bug only occurs at startup
and is caused by an unfinished initialization of the bookmarks when bmh
tries to read them. When this happens, one just needs to reload bmh.
I've submitted a bug (in bugzilla) describing the wyciwyg, back-button
and bmh-not-always-loading-properly-on-windows bug, so perhaps I'll get
some help of mozilla developers on this. For now, I've just removed the
cures that were worse than the disease (v2.1.2.).</p>

<p>Thanks for your extension. I have some little suggestion:</p>
<p>- At bottom near "options" label add a link to the bookmark manager
<br>- At bottom add a link to bookmarkshome project page
<br>- Fix the layout of the folders page in the options: strange effect if you try to resize it
<br>- Add a easy mode to change the style (can be sufficient only change the font size and the page colors)</p>

<p>Great Josh!! Good thinking! I'll put it in asap</p>
<p>Lithian,
<br>I appreciate your suggestions, but 
<br>- ALT-b,m or opening the bookmarks manager with the mouse is easy enough; there is really no need for a link
<br>- You can add this page to your bookmarks. That will display a link on the bmh page.
<br>- I suppose you mean that the folders panel doesn't grow along with
the window? I'll see what I can do about that. Or do you mean something
else?
<br>- I'll think about it. It won't get priority, but if you don't
manage to change the font size or the colors in a stylesheet you like,
you can me send me an email.</p>

<p>Yea! I actually helped out on an extension :) Not bad for a 13 year old eh? (It was my b-day yesterday)</p>
<p>Always glad to help out :) Its working fine over here, because
normally Firefox starts loading the page before you even see the page,
this way Firefox loads the index.html page instead of bmh.html and only
redirects to bmh once its completely loaded, thus making sure the
bookmarks file is completely initilzed.</p>
<p>I sent you the xpi file, although you probably don't need it, since I told you all about it already lol</p>

<p>OK, here are all my main wishes, most of which I could prolly do myself if I would just learn XUL :P</p>
<p>1. Create check box to show/hide the search box, instead of none in the drop down -- the "none" is a little confusing.</p>
<p>2. Create a way for users to save stylesheets, and then chose them
from a drop downn listbox, this way they don't have to copy and paste
them every time they want a change.</p>

<p>3. Tab in the options dialog for users to add their own search enginges (maybe)</p>
<p>4. Fix it so the Options button in the extension manager actually opens the options dialog (instead of being grayed out)</p>
<p>5. Let users specify the seperator bewtween folder levels, instead of the deafult line break</p>
<p>6. The footer should be Options | BMH Homepage (with the latter being linked to the home page of course)</p>
<p>7. As already on the todo list, Ftp upload would be awesome</p>
<p>I know those would be hard, but if implimented this ectension would be THE best extension for firefox..</p>
<p>I will get to work on them and see what I can do, can anyone recomend some good XUL tuts?</p>

<p>Eh, I don't know about magnificent, but it matches my mood :P</p>

<p>Also, I noticed that you don't have the (1) options dialog (2)the
homepage set in install.rdf, you also don't have an icon for the
extension, I have been hacking around, and I set the options dialog,
and I set the homepage, and I gave it an icon (just the home icon in
the qute theme) and I added a link back to the BMH page in the footer
of the generated page.</p>
<p>I mean when I first installed the extension, I had to use google to
find the home page, since it wasn't listed in the rdf files, nor on the
generated page.</p>
<p>I'll send you my xpi if you like..</p>

<p>JK,
<br>I'm not sure what you mean with printing compatibility. I haven't
tried it yet (and, to be honest, bmh is one of the last things I'd want
to print) but it should just print fine. You're right about the length
of this page; I'll do something about it. I'm looking forward to your
stylesheet. You can simply post it here, or send it to me by email if
you want:

<p>Hehe, can you edit/delete comments? If so, please merge all of my
previous comments into one if you wish, I should have done that in the
first place... and better yet, how about I write a php script (if this
server supports PHP) for people to submit their stylesheets, and it
will email them to you, or automaticly post them to the styles page.
(The stylesheets take up a lot of room here!)</p>
<p>I too don't see why you would want to print BMH, you would have a
whole page of link titles, and no idea at all where they would lead to!</p>
<p>Jeroen, I am not sure if mozdev.org supports php/mysql, and if not,
I would be happy to host a phpBB forum for BMH on my site if you wish..
that may be a little better than 24 pages of user notes! (Thats how
long it would be if printed!)</p>
<p>Also, as you stated, I don't see the usefulness in deleting
bookmarks via the context menu, in addition to the fact that modifying
files would be a bit hard to do in javascript, and it would increase
the risk of bookmarks.html being corrupted.

<p>JK, to fix that, set the startup page to
